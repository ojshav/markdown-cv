Projects:
==============
1. Boston House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project
   - The project utilizes the famous Boston House Price Dataset, which contains 13 numeric and categorical predictive attributes. The target variable is the Median Value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's. We'll analyze attributes such as crime rate, residential land zoning, proximity to employment centers, nitric oxides concentration, average number of rooms, pupil-teacher ratio, and more.

2. Nobel Prize Analysis
   - This project aims to analyze the Nobel Prize data to uncover trends, patterns, and interesting insights. By exploring the data, we can gain a better understanding of the distribution of prizes across different categories, identify noteworthy laureates, and explore how the prizes have evolved over time.

3. Google Play Store App Analytics 
   - The goal of this project is to gain insights into the Android app market by analyzing a dataset of Google Play Store apps. The analysis covers various aspects, such as app categories, ratings, reviews, installs, and more. By exploring this dataset, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and relationships that can help app developers, marketers, and stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

4. Mumbai House Price Predictor
   - This project is an end-to-end machine learning application for predicting house prices in Mumbai, India. It takes user inputs such as location, number of bedrooms, and square feet area as features and predicts the price of the house. The machine learning models used for prediction include Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression. The project also includes a Flask backend to provide a user-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing the predictions.
